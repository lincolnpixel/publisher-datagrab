# Publisher Datagrab Support
This extension is made available _without_ support. Emails, private messages, or tickets created at boldminded.com/support about this extension will be ignored. If you find an issue create a pull request here on Github and it will be reviewed when time allows.

In order for this extension to work, the XML or JSON data you are feeding to Datagrab must have a `publisher_lang_id` and `publisher_status` nodes to tell Datagrab what language and status (open|closed) to import the entry as.
